# Privnet Testing

Sutra SDK includes a dedicated testing module `Sutra.PrivnetTest` to simplify integration testing against a private network (like Yaci DevKit).

## Setup

Ensure you have a local Yaci DevKit instance running.

In your test file, `use Sutra.PrivnetTest`:

```elixir
defmodule MyProject.MyTest do
  use Sutra.PrivnetTest
  
  test "test something" do
    # ...
  end
end
```

This automatically checks if Yaci is running and sets up the provider configuration.

## Managing Wallets

### Default Wallets

Access pre-funded default wallets from the Yaci DevKit (indices 0-20):

```elixir
test "uses default wallet" do
  with_default_wallet(0, fn %{address: address, signing_key: key} ->
    # Test logic here
    IO.puts("Wallet Address: #{address}")
  end)
end
```

The wallet is automatically topped up if its balance is zero.

### New Ephemeral Wallets

Create a fresh wallet for isolation:

```elixir
test "uses fresh wallet" do
  with_new_wallet(fn %{address: address, signing_key: key} ->
    # This wallet is funded with 100 ADA by default
  end)
end
```

## Loading Funds

You can explicitly load funds into an address:

```elixir
# Load 1000 ADA
load_ada(address, 1000)

# Load multiple UTxOs
load_ada(address, [1000, 500]) 
```

## Waiting for Transactions

Since blockchain operations are asynchronous, use `await_tx` to wait for a transaction to be confirmed:

```elixir
tx_id = submit_some_transaction()

# detailed info
tx_info = await_tx(tx_id) 

# or assert success
assert Sutra.PrivnetTest.await_tx(tx_id)
```
